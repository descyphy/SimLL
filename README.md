This repo contains designs locked using **SimLL:Similarity-Based Logic Locking Against Machine Learning Attacks** locking technique. For more information on how SimLL works, please visit our [DAC'23 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05870.pdf)

## Locked Designs

Benchmark designs from ISCAS'85 and ITC'99 are locked using different key sizes. The formt of the locked designs is .bench. The key size is included in the file name.

Example: c1355\_K64.bench - c1355 benchmark is locked with 64 key bits.

The correct key value for a locked design is included in the first line of the design file.
